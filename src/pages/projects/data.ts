      "My Goodread's to-read list with ability to sort by the wait time for the book at various libraries",
    motivation: `I'm an avid fiction reader (almost entirely only romance and thrillers) and I get all my ebooks from a bunch of different libraries. I used to go through my to-reads list on Goodreads and search for each book at each library to find a book that is available â€“ a very inefficient system.`,

    motivation:
      "There is an existing website that gives you wikipedia article prompts. My problem with it was that it shows the same articles for everyone in the world for the same amount of time. So if you and your friends finish the round before the time they set for each round, you have to wait for the next round. I am much too impatient for that.",
